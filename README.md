Hello, this is budgety using javascript. you can calculating income and expenses!

This was a code along from an instructor on online courses. I used this course to learn and understand about javascirpt ES5!

However it's not finished yet, because I'm still studying the course.
<b>(UPDATED)</b> DONE

And I'm coding while writing the appropriate explanation that I caught on how it code works (with comment), so I understand and don't forget.  So if there's something wrong with the explanation in the line of code, You are welcome to edit! :)
