# budgety-javascript
Hello, this is budgety using javascript. you can calculating income and expenses!

This was a code along from an instructor on online courses. I used this course to learn and understand about javascirpt!
however it's not finished yet, because I'm still studying the course.

And I'm coding while writing the appropriate explanation that I caught on how it code works, so I understand and don't forget.  So if there's something wrong with the explanation in the line of code, You are welcome to edit :) 
oh ya, I'm still new to Github so I understand a little.
